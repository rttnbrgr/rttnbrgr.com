Hi. My name is Nathan Mateo Rothenberger. I am a designer and developer who has been building things on the internet for over a decade. Most recently, I worked at Sprinklr as a Design System Engineer and UX Designer. I helped build out our design system including the UI Kit, documentation, and design ops for a team of 30+ designers.

I love pulling designs apart and understanding how all of the pieces fit together. I care deeply about the intersection of design and engineering and how those two worlds collaborate to build better products.

I am currently looking for a new opportunity in either the Dallas or Portland area as well as a new hour long drama to dive into. If you have leads on either please reach out.
